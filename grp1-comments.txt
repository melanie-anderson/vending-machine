Overall great job! Not much to complain about, a few minor comments:

1. For your individual classes, there is no need to define these instance 
variables:
	private String name;
	private BigDecimal price;
	private String code;
	private int quantity;

These have been defined in the abstract class already.

2. I like the GetInventory class, but not its name, consider something like
"Warehouse", or "InventoryManager", getInventory sounds like the name for
a method, but otherwise it's a good class.

3. For your change return, a future nice to have, would be to not
display anything for a coin type if the quantity is zero:

Please choose an option >>> 3
The total change dispensed is: $1.95
7 quarters 
2 dimes 
0 nickels 

4. I also feel that makeChange() could be a method of the Funds class, as
the funds class has all the necessary info to generate the correct coinage.
